Todo:

Add collapsible
- Find a good react library for it
- Modify as below


Design:
- Headers to be right-aligned similar to what is there currently
- Boxes to be invisible, but on click, show contents
- Contents to be left aligned

- Maybe add a nice right-left line animation to go above and below box?
(that is, above header of expanded box and underneath content)
